==============================================
   FS25_NPCFAVOR PRE-RELEASE TESTING CHECKLIST
   Version 1.2.2.6 | Development → Main Branch
==============================================

Hey testers! 👋

Before we push this to the public (main branch), we need you to REALLY test this thing. Not just "does it work?" but "what happens when I do something weird?" We want to catch bugs before players do.

📋 SETUP
--------
□ Fresh install of FS25_NPCFavor (delete old version first)
□ Open log.txt in a text editor (auto-refresh on): %USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\log.txt
□ Enable dev console in FS25 settings
□ Test both NEW savegame AND existing savegame

🔴 CRITICAL TESTS (Must pass or we don't ship!)
------------------------------------------------

□ MOD LOADS WITHOUT ERRORS
  - Launch game, load any map
  - Check log.txt for errors (filter for [NPC)
  - Type "npcHelp" in console - does it respond?

□ NPCS SPAWN & MOVE
  - Start new save, wait 60 seconds
  - NPCs should appear and start walking around
  - No stuck NPCs, no frozen animations
  - Try "npcGoto 1" to teleport to an NPC

□ E-KEY INTERACTION WORKS
  - Walk up to an NPC
  - "[E] Talk to" prompt appears when close (within 3m)
  - Press E → dialog opens
  - Dialog shows NPC name, relationship, favor options

□ F6 - FAVOR MENU
  - Press F6 anywhere in game
  - Dialog opens with active favors listed
  - Shows quest text, NPC name
  - Close button works (ESC or click)

□ F7 - NPC LIST
  - Press F7 anywhere in game
  - Shows all NPCs with names, relationship tiers
  - "Go To" button teleports you to NPC
  - Close button works

□ FAVOR SYSTEM END-TO-END
  - Accept a favor from an NPC
  - Favor appears in F6 menu
  - Complete the objective (deliver item, borrow equipment, etc.)
  - Return to NPC → they acknowledge completion
  - You get rewards (money, relationship increase)
  - Favor removed from F6 list

□ RELATIONSHIP PROGRESSION
  - Talk to a new NPC (should be Stranger or Acquaintance)
  - Complete 2-3 favors for same NPC
  - Relationship tier increases (watch for tier-up message)
  - Check that points are tracked correctly

□ SAVE & LOAD
  - Play for 30 min, build relationships, accept favors
  - Save game (check log for errors)
  - Exit to menu, reload save
  - All NPCs back in same spots?
  - Relationships preserved?
  - Active favors still there?

□ MULTIPLAYER SYNC (Test if possible!)
  - Host a multiplayer session
  - Client joins → sees same NPCs as host
  - Client talks to NPC → interaction works
  - Client completes favor → relationship updates for everyone
  - Late join (30+ min into session) → new client sees all NPCs correctly

🟡 HIGH PRIORITY TESTS (Should pass, but not blockers)
-------------------------------------------------------

□ PERFORMANCE WITH 50 NPCS
  - Use console to spawn max NPCs (50)
  - Play for 20 minutes
  - FPS still good? No lag spikes?

□ LONG SESSION (2+ hours)
  - Play for 2 real-time hours
  - Any slowdowns? Memory leaks? Weird behavior?

□ LANGUAGE SWITCHING
  - Change FS25 language in settings
  - Restart game, open mod dialogs
  - Text translates correctly? (10 languages supported)
  - No missing text or weird characters?

🟢 EDGE CASE TESTS (Nice to have)
----------------------------------

□ SPAM KEYS
  - Mash E key repeatedly near NPC
  - Spam F6/F7 open/close
  - Game still stable?

□ STUCK NPC RECOVERY
  - Find NPC stuck in a wall/fence
  - Wait 60 seconds
  - Does NPC teleport out or unstuck itself?

□ INVALID DATA
  - Edit npc_favor_data.xml in savegame folder (add junk data)
  - Load save → mod handles gracefully? (Warning in log, fallback to defaults)

📝 HOW TO REPORT BUGS
---------------------

If you find something broken, post in #bug-reports with:

**Bug**: [Short description]
**Severity**: Critical / High / Medium / Low
**Steps**:
1. [What you did]
2. [What happened]

**Expected**: [What should have happened]
**Log excerpt**: [Paste lines from log.txt with [NPC prefix]
**Multiplayer?**: Yes/No (Host/Client)

🎯 RELEASE CRITERIA
-------------------

We release to main when:
✅ All CRITICAL tests pass
✅ No Lua errors in log
✅ No crashes or freezes
✅ Save/load works perfectly
✅ Multiplayer sync confirmed working
✅ Performance stable (50 NPCs, 2+ hour sessions)

🧪 TIPS FOR TESTERS
-------------------

✨ Be weird! - Do unexpected things. Players will.
✨ Think like a user - Is this fun? Confusing? Too many clicks?
✨ Check the log - Most bugs leave traces in log.txt
✨ Use debug mode - Type "npcDebug" to see NPC internal state
✨ Test both solo AND multiplayer if you can
✨ Try different maps - Some maps might break things others don't
✨ Quality over speed - We'd rather delay a day than ship broken
