## Partially Working / Known Issues

### NPC Vehicles
- [ ] Vehicle prop code exists but no vehicles spawn or render
- [ ] `spawnNPCTractor`, `seatNPCInVehicle`, `unseatNPCFromVehicle` are implemented but i3d models can't be loaded from game pak archives at runtime
- [ ] NPCs walk everywhere; driving state exists but is non-functional
- [ ] Vehicle mode setting exists (hybrid/realistic/visual) but has no visible effect

### Social Behaviors
- [ ] Group gatherings position NPCs correctly but generate no conversation content
- [ ] Walking pairs form but produce no speech bubbles (only 1-on-1 socializing works)
- [ ] Friday party, harvest gathering, morning market, Sunday rest events exist in code but are untested

### Localization
- [ ] Mood prefixes, backstories, and personality-flavored dialog are English-only
- [ ] Core UI, settings, and relationship labels are fully localized in all 10 languages

### Favors
- [ ] "Borrow tractor" favor has no interaction menu option (issue #14)
- [ ] Favor progress tracking is implemented but some favor types lack completion detection

### Multiplayer
- [ ] Multiplayer sync infrastructure is complete but multiplayer is untested
- [ ] State sync, interaction routing, and settings sync events all implemented

---

## Planned / Not Started

### Short-Term
- [ ] Custom map hotspot icon (current: built-in exclamation mark; custom icon.dds fails from ZIP)
- [ ] Close GitHub issues that are fixed (#2, #12 fixed but still Open on GitHub)
- [ ] Test multiplayer functionality end-to-end

### Medium-Term
- [ ] Make NPC vehicles functional (major engine limitation to solve)
- [ ] Vehicle parking logic near destinations (VISION: vehicles park at work/shop/home)
- [ ] Group conversation content for gatherings and walking pairs
- [ ] Localize flavor text (backstories, mood dialog, personality responses) in all 10 languages
- [ ] Favor completion detection for all 7 favor types
- [ ] NPC memory system driving behavior (10 records per NPC exist but don't influence decisions yet)
- [ ] Contextual favor triggers (NPC vehicle breaks down, missed delivery, weather emergency)
- [ ] Player-offered favors (currently only NPCs can request; VISION: player can offer help too)
- [ ] NPC role differentiation (farmer, shop owner, contractor, resident affect schedules and favor types)
- [ ] Personality-preferred favor types (generous NPCs ask different favors than grumpy ones)

### Long-Term / Aspirational
- [ ] NPCs requesting favors proactively (approaching the player)
- [ ] NPCs refusing help based on past behavior patterns
- [ ] Reputation-based unlocks (discounts at shops, access to special tasks)
- [ ] Visiting NPCs at home (knock on door, home-based interactions)
- [ ] Home-based mood modifiers (distance from home, home condition affecting NPC mood)
- [ ] Word of mouth (NPCs share opinions about the player with each other, indirect consequences)
- [ ] Economy tie-ins (NPC farm output affects local market prices)
- [ ] Hooks for other mods to register custom NPCs or favor types
- [ ] Southern hemisphere season support
- [ ] Relative time formatting in UI ("2 hours ago", "yesterday")

## Explicitly Out of Scope

- Full NPC life simulation (eating, sleeping animations, interior homes)
- Interior NPC homes (homes are logical anchors, not enterable buildings)
- Heavy dialogue trees or branching narratives
- Romance / dating mechanics

## Guiding Principle

> Every item on this list should support the core goal: making NPCs feel *noticed*, *persistent*, and *socially meaningful* without overwhelming the farming experience.

This list is expected to evolve as FS25 modding constraints and design ideas change.
